Graph Type datatypes are for storing information about vertices and edges. Graph type is based on the JsonB datatype, but has been modified to allow for more datatypes to be stored other than what is described in RFC 7159. All data stored in a vertex or edge must be compatible with these types or the data will be cast to a string before being stored.

NOTE: More datatypes are planned to be added.
